# Supabase Authentication Setup Guide

## Current Status
**❌ Login NOT Connected to Supabase User Table**

The system has been prepared with a complete Supabase authentication implementation but requires the correct DATABASE_URL to establish connection.

## What's Already Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- `roles` table with default roles (FAE, ADMIN, CANVASSER, SUPERVISOR)
- `user_roles` junction table linking Supabase auth.users to application roles
- `employees` table for staff records with Supabase user linking
- Row Level Security policies for secure data access

### 2. Server-Side Authentication
- Supabase client integration with role-based access control
- JWT token generation with role information
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- User role management functions

### 3. Client-Side Authentication
- Modern AuthProvider with React Context
- Automatic role-based routing after login
- Session management with Supabase auth state
- Error handling and loading states

## Required Steps to Complete Connection

### Step 1: Database Connection
Provide the correct DATABASE_URL from your Supabase project:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]/postgres
```

### Step 2: Database Initialization
Run the provided SQL setup script in your Supabase SQL editor:
- Creates required tables (roles, user_roles, employees)
- Sets up Row Level Security policies
- Inserts default roles
- Creates utility functions

### Step 3: User Creation
Create users in Supabase Auth and assign roles:
```sql
-- After creating users via Supabase Auth, assign roles:
SELECT assign_user_role('[user-uuid]', 'FAE');
SELECT assign_user_role('[user-uuid]', 'ADMIN');
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Client Login**: User enters credentials on login page
2. **Supabase Auth**: System authenticates via Supabase auth.signInWithPassword()
3. **Role Lookup**: Server queries user_roles table for permissions
4. **JWT Generation**: Server creates token with user ID, email, and roles
5. **Client Routing**: User redirected based on role (FAE → Team Creation, ADMIN → Control Panel)

## Current Implementation Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users assigned specific roles with permissions
- **Secure Authentication**: Leverages Supabase's built-in security
- **Employee Integration**: Staff records linked to authentication accounts
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and security policies

## Next Actions Required

1. Update DATABASE_URL with correct Supabase connection string
2. Run database-setup.sql in Supabase SQL editor
3. Create test users in Supabase Auth dashboard
4. Assign roles to users via SQL functions
5. Test login with real Supabase credentials

Once these steps are completed, the login system will be fully connected to the Supabase user table with comprehensive role-based authentication.
