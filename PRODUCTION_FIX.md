# Production API Routes Fix

## Issue RESOLVED
API routes were returning 404 errors in production because static file serving middleware intercepted requests before they reached API handlers.

## Root Cause
The `serveStatic` function in `server/vite.ts` contains a catch-all route that serves `index.html` for all requests, including API routes.

## Solution Implemented
Created custom static file serving middleware that properly excludes API routes:

1. **Custom Static Serving**: `server/static-fix.ts` - Handles static files without intercepting API routes
2. **Production Middleware Order**: API routes → Custom static serving → Error handling
3. **Proper API Protection**: Non-existent API routes return proper JSON error responses

## Files Modified
- `server/index.ts` - Applied custom static serving for production
- `server/static-fix.ts` - New custom static middleware with API protection
- `server/production-fix.ts` - Production-specific API handling (no longer used)

## Status
✅ **PRODUCTION FIX COMPLETE**
✅ API endpoints work correctly in production (tested with `/api/auth/signin`)
✅ POST requests to API routes return proper responses
✅ Custom static serving prevents API route interference
✅ Production deployment ready

## Verification
- POST `/api/auth/signin` with valid credentials: ✅ Returns JWT token
- Production static file serving: ✅ Works without interfering with API routes
- Error handling: ✅ Proper JSON responses for API errors

**Note**: Development mode still uses Vite middleware which may serve HTML for non-existent API routes, but this doesn't affect production deployment.
