# Production API Routes Fix

## Issue
API routes returning 404 errors in production because static file serving middleware intercepts requests before they reach API handlers.

## Root Cause
The `serveStatic` function in `server/vite.ts` contains a catch-all route that serves `index.html` for all requests, including API routes. This happens because:

1. API routes are registered first
2. Static middleware is added after
3. The catch-all route `app.use("*", ...)` intercepts ALL requests

## Solution
Move API route registration to happen AFTER error handling but BEFORE static serving to ensure proper request handling order.

## Files Modified
- `server/index.ts` - Fixed middleware order
- `server/routes.ts` - Fixed TypeScript errors 
- `server/storage.ts` - Fixed data type mismatches

## Status
✅ Production routing fix implemented
✅ TypeScript errors resolved
✅ API endpoints now properly accessible in production
