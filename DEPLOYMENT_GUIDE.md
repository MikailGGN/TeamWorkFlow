   - Create new project
   - Note your project URL and anon key

2. **Configure Database**
   - Run the provided `supabase-setup.sql` script in SQL Editor
   - This creates all 17 required tables with proper relationships
   - Enables Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

3. **Get Connection String**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Database
   - Copy the Connection String (Transaction mode)
   - Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password

### Option 2: Self-Hosted PostgreSQL

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   
   # macOS
   brew install postgresql
   ```

2. **Create Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE fieldforce_pro;
   CREATE USER fieldforce_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fieldforce_pro TO fieldforce_user;
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script**
   ```bash
   psql -d fieldforce_pro -f supabase-setup.sql
   ```

## Application Deployment

### Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
