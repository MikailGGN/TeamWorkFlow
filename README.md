## Deployment to cPanel Shared Hosting

### Prerequisites

- cPanel shared hosting with Node.js support
- SSH/Terminal access (if available)
- File Manager access via cPanel

### Method 1: Using Terminal (Recommended)

If your shared hosting provider supports SSH access:

1. **Connect via SSH:**
```bash
ssh username@your-domain.com
```

2. **Navigate to your domain's directory:**
```bash
cd public_html  # or your domain folder
```

3. **Clone or upload your project:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> .
# OR upload via File Manager and extract
```

4. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install --production
```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
nano .env
```

Add your production environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL="your_production_database_url"
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

6. **Build the application:**
```bash
npm run build
```

7. **Configure Node.js in cPanel:**
   - Go to cPanel â†’ "Node.js Apps" or "Setup Node.js App"
   - Create a new Node.js application
   - Set Node.js version to 18+ 
   - Set Application Root to your domain folder
   - Set Startup File to `server/index.js`
   - Set Environment Variables from your `.env` file

8. **Start the application:**
   - Click "Start App" in cPanel Node.js interface
   - Or run: `npm start`

### Method 2: Using File Manager

If SSH is not available:

1. **Prepare your files locally:**
```bash
npm run build
npm prune --production
```

2. **Create a deployment package:**
```bash
zip -r fieldforce-pro.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" "*.log"
```

3. **Upload via cPanel File Manager:**
   - Login to cPanel
   - Open File Manager
   - Navigate to `public_html` or your domain folder
   - Upload `fieldforce-pro.zip`
   - Extract the files

4. **Install dependencies via cPanel Terminal:**
   - Open "Terminal" in cPanel
   - Navigate to your app directory
   - Run: `npm install --production`

5. **Configure Node.js App:**
   - Follow steps 7-8 from Method 1

### Database Setup

For shared hosting with PostgreSQL:

1. **Create database in cPanel:**
   - Go to "PostgreSQL Databases"
   - Create new database and user
   - Note the connection details

2. **Update DATABASE_URL:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
```

3. **Run migrations:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### Domain Configuration

1. **Set up subdomain (optional):**
   - Create subdomain in cPanel (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
   - Point it to your Node.js application folder

2. **Configure main domain:**
   - If using main domain, ensure your Node.js app is in the correct folder
   - Update cPanel redirects if necessary

### Environment Variables for Production

Create `.env` file with production values:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname"

# Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Security (generate strong secrets)
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-key"

# Optional: External APIs
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your-google-maps-key"
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Port Conflicts:**
- Most shared hosts assign specific ports
- Check cPanel Node.js settings for assigned port
- Update your app configuration accordingly

**Memory Limits:**
- Shared hosting has memory restrictions
- Monitor app performance in cPanel
- Consider upgrading hosting plan if needed

**File Permissions:**
```bash
chmod -R 755 public_html
chmod -R 644 public_html/*.js
```

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify database credentials in cPanel
- Check if remote connections are allowed
- Ensure DATABASE_URL format is correct

**Node.js Version:**
- Ensure your hosting supports Node.js 18+
- Update package.json engines if needed:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0",
  "npm": ">=8.0.0"
}
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable compression:**
```javascript
// Add to server/index.ts
import compression from 'compression';
app.use(compression());
```

2. **Static file caching:**
```javascript
app.use(express.static('dist', {
  maxAge: '1d',
  etag: false
}));
```

3. **Database connection pooling:**
```javascript
// Configure in your database connection
{
  max: 10,
  min: 2,
  idle: 10000
}
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor application logs in cPanel
- Set up automated backups for database
- Regular dependency updates: `npm audit fix`
- Monitor disk space and memory usage

### Security Considerations

- Use strong JWT and session secrets
- Enable HTTPS in cPanel
- Regular security updates
- Implement rate limiting for APIs
- Validate all user inputs

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check cPanel error logs
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Contact your hosting provider for Node.js specific support
